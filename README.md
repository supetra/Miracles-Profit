To illustrate the importance of courage and action, imitate people learn to swim. To be able to swim theories is needed. But it was not enough. Mastering the theory of how to swim, does not mean we can not swim. So what should we do so that we could swim? There is no other choice we must have the courage to throw themselves in the pool and start to move. Indeed, there are times when we are sinking, swimming pools and even drinking water. It is part of the risk we must take. Believe dare to take action by jumping into the pool will make us really can swim.  Just do it, magic happens! Do that, and the magic will happen!
